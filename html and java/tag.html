        background information.

<br><br>though most paragraphs should have a topic sentence,
<BR> there are a few situations when a paragraph might not need a topic sentence.
For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates
 a series of events, if a paragraph continues developing an idea that you introduced\
(with a topic sentence) in the previous paragraph<br>, or if all the sentences and details
in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a main point. The vast majority of 
your paragraphs,
 however, should have a topic sentence.<br>
